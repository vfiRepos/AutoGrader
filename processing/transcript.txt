Rep (James, VFI): Hi Karen, this is James with VFI. We specialize in equipment financing solutions. Did I catch you at a decent time?
Client (Karen): I’ve got about 20 minutes before my next meeting, so let’s jump in.
James: Great. I’ll keep it short. VFI has been in business for more than three decades and has funded billions in assets globally. We’re a direct lender with capital ready to deploy, so we can move quickly on your financing needs.
Karen: Okay, that’s good to know. What’s different about your financing compared to what I could get from my bank?
James: Well, we’re reliable, experienced, and responsive. You can feel confident throughout the process because we’ve done this for years.
Karen: I understand, but what about terms — interest rates, repayment flexibility?
James: Uh, we’re very transparent, and you’ll always know what to expect. Our clients trust us.
Karen: Sure, but can you give me an example of a project similar to ours and how you structured it?
James: I don’t have the exact numbers in front of me, but we’ve supported global clients in many industries. The main thing is, we move fast and don’t waste your time.
Karen: Alright… my CFO is mostly concerned about cash flow management. Leasing might be better than taking on more loans — what would you recommend?
James: (hesitant) Leasing could definitely work. I’d have to get back to you on the specific advantages in your case.
Karen: Hmm, okay.
James: But I can assure you — we’re highly responsive. You’ll always have me picking up the phone, and that’s what sets us apart.
Karen: Responsiveness is great, but we need to see numbers to make a decision.
James: Right, I’ll pull together some options and get back to you by Friday.
Karen: Sounds good. Let’s touch base then.
